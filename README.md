                                                      👋 Hi, I'm Jesus David Pedraza

                                                                About me👨‍💻

- 💻I'm a Software Engineering student and passionate about high-performance sports

Fluent in Spanish, English B1

💡The best ideas often emerge in the least expected moments, transforming the ordinary into the extraordinary. 🎯 I'm deeply committed to everything related to software and technology, from creating innovative solutions to driving projects that generate real impact. For me, every challenge is an opportunity to learn, grow, and create something that makes a difference. "Software development is not just about writing code, it's about solving problems." The most exciting thing is that anyone with passion, curiosity, and effort can master this art. Beyond technology, my curiosity takes me to other areas, from science to culture, always looking for a connection that can enrich my perspective and the way I face challenges.

Let's turn ideas into powerful realities and help others discover their own path to innovation. 🌟

- 🌱 I am currently learning how to use AWS and deepening my knowledge in TypeScript and JavaScript

📚I am currently finishing my studies at the University of Santander UDES
